    "For this program to work you need to first go to: https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ and select the files to download.\n",

    "In this example, I chose my data by using the following steps:\n",
    "    1. Navigate to `Exploration` tab\n",
    "    2. Selected `kidney` as the Primary Site\n",
    "    3. Selected `solid tissue normal` and `primary tumor` for my Sample Type (823 cases)\n",
    "    4. Clicked `View Files in Repository`\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since I'm only interested in RNAseq count data and Methylation beta values, I filter my files to only include these two types of files.   \n",
    "    5. Selected `RNA-seq` as my Experimental Strategy\n",
    "    6. Selected `HTSeq - Counts` in Workflow Type\n",
    "    7. Clicked `Add all files to cart` (945 files, 815 cases)\n",

    "    \n",
    "Now I navigated to my cart which had 1777 files in it. Since it is recomended to use th GDC-data transfer tool (which scidat uses) I only download the `manifest` and the `metadata` for my files of interest.\n",
