Sci-Download-Annotate-TCGA wraps around the API for TCGA and provides some simple interfaces for RNAseq, DNA methylation
and clinical information from TCGA. These include downloading data from manifest files (also doing this in parallel),
annotating the downloaded RNA and DNA methylation data with their clinical information and merging these dataframes to
have a joint DNA methylation and RNAseq dataset (and adding information from biomart to these).
